NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckVersionIncrement - Prevent a release unless
    the version number is incremented

VERSION
    version 0.120080

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini

        [CheckVersionIncrement]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin prevents your from releasing a distribution unless it has a
    version number *greater* than the latest version already indexed on
    CPAN.

    Note that this plugin doesn't check whether your release method actually
    involves the CPAN or not. So if you don't use the UploadToCPAN plugin
    for releases, then you probably shouldn't use this one either.

METHODS
  before_release
    This method checks the version of the dist to be released against the
    latest version already indexed on CPAN. If the version to be released is
    not greater than the indexed version, it prompts the user to confirm the
    release.

    This method does nothing if the dist is not indexed at all.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    Please report any bugs or feature requests to
    "rct+perlbug@thompsonclan.org".
