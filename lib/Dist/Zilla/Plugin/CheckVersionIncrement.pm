=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckVersionIncrement - Prevent a release unless the version number is incremented

=head1 VERSION

version 0.120050

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>

    [CheckVersionIncrement]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin prevents your from releasing a distribution unless it has
a version number I<greater> than the latest version already indexed on
CPAN.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 before_release

This method checks the version of the dist to be released against the
latest version already indexed on CPAN. If the version to be released
is not greater than the indexed version, it prompts the user to
confirm the release.

This method does nothing if the dist is not indexed at all.

C<rct+perlbug@thompsonclan.org>.
